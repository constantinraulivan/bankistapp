# Bankist App

It is a web application that simulates a banking application. Similar to any banking application, you can log in to the application using a username and password, delete your account, transfer money to other users, and request loans.

I created this application as part of the course 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!' Specifically, I built all the application's features from scratch using the JavaScript programming language.

# The purpose of the application in the learning process

The purpose of the application in the learning process:

This application has significantly enhanced my understanding of JavaScript, particularly in terms of working with strings, arrays and dates in JavaScript.

In addition to mastering various strings, arrays and dates manipulation methods, I have also learned how to create a timer and gained some proficiency in DOM manipulation."
